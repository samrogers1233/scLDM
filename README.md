# scLDM
Rapid advances in single-cell sequencing technologies have enabled researchers to more deeply characterize cellular responses to external perturbations at the gene expression level. However, the limited availability of perturbed samples and the high cost of sequencing create an urgent need for reliable in silico methods to predict perturbation responses in single-cell gene expression. Existing approaches often fail to explicitly model cell-intrinsic features that shape perturbation responses, and they commonly suffer from oversmoothed generations and training instability. Here, we propose scLDM, a generative framework based on a latent diffusion model for predicting perturbation responses in single-cell gene expression. scLDM integrates a variational autoencoder with a conditional diffusion model, performing alignment and representation learning over conditioning information—such as pre-perturbation cellular states and gene perturbation types—in the latent space, and using these conditions to constrain the diffusion denoising process for high-fidelity generation of post-perturbation transcriptomes. We conducted systematic experiments across diverse perturbation settings, and the results show that scLDM achieves higher predictive accuracy in tasks involving multi-cell-type drug stimulation, viral infection, bacterial infection, and cross-species perturbations. Moreover, in both single-gene and combinatorial multi-gene perturbation prediction tasks, scLDM consistently yields superior generation quality.
